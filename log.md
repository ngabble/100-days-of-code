# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did a couple of challenge programs at HackerRank.com

**Thoughts:** Challenge programs are a good way to practice using C# to solve different problems, but I should start pushing myself to optimize the solutions, rather than just getting the right answers.

### Day 1: May 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I got deep into UML

**Thoughts:** These UML diagrams are a great way to visualize coding projects, especially those projects you can't fully wrap your arms around. 

**Link to work:** I might add a link later

### Day 2: May 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did a single of challenge programs at HackerRank.com

**Thoughts:** This one kicked my butt. I spent an hour yesterday trying to massage the data into place. I might have been able to brute force it with a O(n) loop, but I stuck to a math solution and got a much faster solution, eventually.

### Day 3: May 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More challenge programs at HackerRank.com

**Thoughts:** I tried brute force yet again. It worked for almost all of the solutions, so my code was sound, which felt good, but it timed-out at large n values :(
