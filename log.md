# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did a couple of challenge programs at HackerRank.com

**Thoughts:** Challenge programs are a good way to practice using C# to solve different problems, but I should start pushing myself to optimize the solutions, rather than just getting the right answers.
